For the following analysis here are the various findings I was able to find.

Latitude vs. Temperature Plot

The Chart is comparing the Temperature vs the Latitude of multiple cities. You can infer that there is a relationship as the higher the latitude the lower the temp. You can validate this with a regression line.

Latitude vs. Humidity Plot
The Chart is comparing the Temperature vs the Latitude of multiple cities. There seems to be less of a relationship with humidity. It may be interesting to look at Longitude to see if there is a better cluster

Latitude vs. Cloudiness Plot
On Feb 2/5/22, there seems to be very polaring cloudiness as it cluster closes to 100 and 0 coordinates. So there is a very loose relationship as you go up an down the equator.

Latitude vs. Wind Speed Plot
This graph is looking at windspeed at various horizontal points of the world. It seems that the 7mph was the average wind speed across the world and ther were some outliers in the higher latitude areas (near the north pole)

Northern Hemisphere - Max Temp vs. Latitude Linear Regression
Temp and Latitude have a strong inverse relationship in the northern hemp. This means as the latitudes go up the temp go down. We can feel confident that this may be a good indicator for other datapoints becuase we have a strong R^2

Southern Hemisphere - Max Temp vs. Latitude Linear Regression
Conversely, in the Southern Hemisphere, currently there is a weaker positive correlation where the temps go up as the latitudes come closer to the equator. it is summer time in the southern hemp so it drives these results.

Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
Very Weak correlation betwen Humidity and Lat in The northern Hemp

Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
Very Weak correlation betwen Humidity and Lat in The Southern Hemp. This is not statistically significant.

Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
Very Weak correlation betwen Humidity and Lat in The Northern Hemp. This is not statistically significant.

Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
Very Weak correlation betwen Humidity and Lat in The Southern Hemp. This is not statistically significant.

Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
Very Weak correlation betwen Humidity and Lat in The Northern Hemp. This is not statistically significant.

Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
Very Weak inverse correlation betwen Humidity and Lat in The Southern Hemp. This is not statistically significant.
